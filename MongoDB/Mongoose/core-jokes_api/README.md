# Jokes API assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to practice using MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose together to create a back-end server and database. Once that was created, use Postman to populate the database, and then edit and delete entries.  Here are the details of the assignment:

>To solidify what we've read about mongoose commands and express, lets create a new express project from scratch called "Jokes."
>
>The following wireframe is to show examples of routes (full URLs) and then the returned json.  You are NOT required to create a front end for this assignment.  Please use Postman to verify your routes and output.
>
>You will need to include the following routes:
>
>**Route**                 **VERB**     **Description**
>
>/api/jokes                 GET         get all jokes
>
>/api/jokes                 POST        create a new joke
>
>/api/jokes/:_id            GET         return a single joke matching this _id
>
>/api/jokes/:_id            PUT         update a single joke matching this _id
>
>/api/jokes/:_id            DELETE      delete a single joke matching this _id
