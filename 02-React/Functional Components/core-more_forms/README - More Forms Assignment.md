 #More Forms Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to add error messages based on JS validation in a component. Here were the requirements:

1. If the First Name or Last Name is less than 2 characters, output an error message saying that field must be at least 2 characters.
2. The e-mail is less than 5 characters, say the field must be at least 5 characters.
3. The passwords must match and be at least 8 characters.
4. Sensei Bonus (optional): Only show the validations if the input is not blank (You should not see the error messages if you have not typed anything in)

All four of these requirements were met.
