README - Convert to Arrow

This practice assignment was assigned to practice refacorting JS code into arrow functions. I commented out the old code so you are able to see what code was refactored.

Here is the context and the tasks for this assignment:

    You are at a company that does not have a great front end for its website, but they pride themselves on their JavaScript. Since they only care about adding random JavaScript functionality, they don't want you to change the CSS of this site. They have given you a task to update the Javascript in their site to ES6, so that every method being called uses arrow functions.

    Take the following HTML and update all functions to arrow functions.

    Tasks:
    1. Update all methods to become Arrow functions

    2. Connect the EventListener `setBackgroundColorById` to the paragraph in the HTML
